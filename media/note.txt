The media directory is typically used to store user-uploaded files,
such as images, videos, and documents.

In contrast, the static directory is used to store static files, such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files
that are used in your application's templates and served directly to users.

Since user-uploaded files and static files have different purposes and requirements,
it's best practice to keep them in separate directories at the same level as your Django project,
rather than inside the static directory.

So, you should create the media directory at the same level as your Django project directory,
alongside the static directory
